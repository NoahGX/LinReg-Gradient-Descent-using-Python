# Linear Regression and Gradient Descent using Python

## Overview
The purpose of this Jupyter notebook is to explore linear regression models through practical coding examples using gradient descent. It includes a detailed walkthrough of building and improving a linear regression model, analyzing its performance, and making predictions using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.

## Features
- Implementation of linear regression from scratch.
- Use of gradient descent to optimize model parameters.
- Generation of synthetic datasets to test the models.
- Calculation and visualization of model performance and loss metrics.

## Usage
- Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
- Run the cells from top to bottom to understand the program better.
- Modify parameters or input data as needed to see different results.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for plotting)

## Input
The main input for this notebook is a synthetic dataset generated within the notebook itself. Users can modify the parameters of the dataset generation function to experiment with different types of data.

## Output
- Predicted values using the linear regression model.
- Visualizations of the model fit on the data.
- Loss metrics (e.g., MSE) to evaluate model performance.

## Notes
- The notebook is basic and intended to illustrate the concepts of linear regression and gradient descent.
- It does not include any real-world dataset but instead focuses on synthesized data to ensure a clear understanding of the mechanics involved.
